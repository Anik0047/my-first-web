    <h2>Anik Barua World</h2>
    <p>My name is Anik Barua.It is very easy to say something about others and even to pass one’s  comments on their activities, good or bad. But it is very difficult to say  anything about oneself. It is because if one talks highly of oneself, one  will be dubbed as an egoist. If one talks lowly of oneself, one may be  disparaged as one suffering from inferiority complex.</p>

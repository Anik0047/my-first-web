            <p>My name is Anik Barua.It is very easy to say something about others and even to pass one’s comments on
                their activities, good or bad. But it is very difficult to say anything about oneself. It is because if
                one talks highly of oneself, one will be dubbed as an egoist. If one talks lowly of oneself, one may be
                disparaged as one suffering from inferiority complex.</p>

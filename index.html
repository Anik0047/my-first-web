            <p>My name is Anik Barua.It is very easy to say something about others and even to pass one’s comments on
                their activities, good or bad. But it is very difficult to say anything about oneself. It is because if
                one talks highly of oneself, one will be dubbed as an egoist. If one talks lowly of oneself, one may be
                disparaged as one suffering from inferiority complex.</p>

            <h1>japanese kyoto</h1>
            <p>The Kyoto Garden was opened in 1991. It was a gift from the city of Kyoto to commemorate the long
                friendship between Japan and Great Britain. Today, the Kyoto Garden is a popular part of Holland Park –
                but it’s not the only Japanese garden in this green space. In July 2012, the Fukushima Memorial Garden
                was officially opened. It commemorates the gratitude of the Japanese people to the British people for
                their support following the natural disasters that struck in March 2011.</p>
